# MJ's Pret - Website

This repository contains a small static website for MJ's Pret.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main HTML file.
- `styles.css` — extracted CSS from the original inline style.
- `favicon.svg` — simple SVG favicon.

Preview locally:
1. Extract the repository or clone it.
2. Run a simple HTTP server and open http://localhost:8000:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Node (serve): `npx serve` 

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. In the repository on GitHub, go to Settings → Pages.
2. Under "Build and deployment", choose "Deploy from a branch" and select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
3. Save. After a minute the site should be available at: `https://muskanjaved34-dot.github.io/Mjs-pret-website/`

If you'd like, I can also prepare real product images, add a contact form, or create a `gh-pages` branch and set up the site there.
